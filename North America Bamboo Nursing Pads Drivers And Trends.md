This trend is further fueled by the rising demand for natural and organic materials in personal care items. Additionally, the growing awareness of the potential harm caused by synthetic materials in traditional nursing pads has led to a shift towards bamboo alternatives, which are considered gentler on the skin and less irritating for mothers post-delivery.</p><p>Another significant factor contributing to the market growth is the increased focus on maternal health and wellness. More new mothers are seeking products that offer comfort, convenience, and safety, leading to a preference for bamboo nursing pads.
