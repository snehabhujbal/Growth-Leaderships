The region's increasing adoption of biologic therapies and the rising prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis, are key drivers for the market's growth. The availability of adalimumab biosimilars in Latin America has also played a significant role in expanding market access and affordability, thereby contributing to the overall market expansion. The market's growth is further supported by the growing healthcare infrastructure in the region and the rising number of patients seeking effective treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Additionally, the increasing awareness of biologic treatments and the evolving healthcare policies in several LATAM countries are expected to fuel the demand for adalimumab in the coming years.
